Encounter with NeXT Computer

When I was working for Tokyo Electric Power Company, the department I belonged to happened to have a NeXT Computer for research purposes. It was the first-generation NeXT Cube.

Until then, I had knowledge of UNIX as a theoretical study, but I had hardly ever worked directly with UNIX. NeXT was essentially the first UNIX machine I had ever touched. It was truly a shocking encounter. The kernel was Mach, and the window system was Display PostScript, which was adopted entirely instead of X-Window, which was the mainstream in UNIX at the time. The hardware was equipped with DSP and MO (magneto-optical disk), which were rare at the time, and the case was beautifully designed. However, what surprised me the most was the Interface Builder. Interface Builder has been taken over by Xcode in current MacOS, and I think many people who have used Interface Builder may wonder what is so amazing about it. However, at that time, I could not intuitively understand how it was possible to test U/I without compiling or linking in a compiled language like Objective-C. It was as if I was seeing magic. There is a video of Steve Jobs giving a demo of Interface Builder on NeXT, so please check it out!

Getting a NeXT Station

Completely fascinated by NeXT, I began to have a great admiration for Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where Mach was born. When I decided to study abroad, CMU became my first choice of university, largely due to the influence of NeXT. Fortunately, I was given the opportunity to attend my first-choice school and lived in Pittsburgh from 1992 to 1995.

The relationship between NeXT and CMU was very close, so there were many NeXT computers installed on campus (of course, there were also many other workstations, such as DEC, Sun, HP, and Omron. However, the OS of the machines in the Computer Science department was almost entirely Mach). Therefore, I had plenty of opportunities to work with NeXT on campus, but my desire to own my own NeXT gradually grew stronger. Many American universities sell computers to students at a significant discount. Fortunately, CMU was selling NeXT computers to students at a discount, as well as IBM-PC compatible and Mac, so I felt that I had to take advantage of this privilege as a student, and just before returning to Japan, I purchased my long-awaited NeXT at a student discount. However, it was not a Cube, but a pizza-box-style NeXT Station. There was also a color display model called NeXT Station Color, but it was a bit too expensive for me to afford, so I bought a monochrome model of NeXT Station. I don't remember the exact price, but I think it was around $2,000 to $3,000. It was a little more expensive than the price of a PC at that time, but the market price of NeXT at that time (especially in Japan) was much higher, so I felt that I had made a great deal.

Dormancy, and revival! I obtained the coveted NeXT Station machine in such a way, and for a while after returning to Japan, I played with it at home. However, as my children grew up and began to cause mischief, it became difficult to keep NeXT at hand. So, I decided to temporarily evacuate NeXT to my parents' house. Thus, it was quietly stored in the attic of my parents' house, and time passed in the blink of an eye, and it remained in that state for about 20 years.

However, both of my parents passed away, and last year, we had to demolish the house, so I brought NeXT back home again. When I tried to boot it up for the first time in 20 years, I was surprised to find that it booted up properly and the applications worked too! Interface Builder, of course, Lotus Improv, a revolutionary (in my opinion) spreadsheet, TopDraw, a drawing software similar to Illustrator, and a partially completed application demo all worked perfectly, and I was amazed. The email software that comes standard with NeXT is NeXT Mail, a MIME-based multimedia email that was still rare at the time. There was one email in the mailbox with Steve Jobs' signed, of course, it wasn't sent to me personally, it was a mail that came with NeXT Mail from the beginning, but it still made me feel emotional.

Exploring a second life for the NeXT Station
I would love to continue using my NeXT Station at home, but the reality is that my living space is already quite cramped with many lab machines taking up room, making it difficult to carve out additional space for my NeXT machine.

So, I took to Twitter to ask for ideas on how to put my beloved NeXT to good use.

Twitter campaign seeking ideas for my beloved NeXT machine

To my surprise, I received a great deal of feedback and suggestions, including comments like "I remember using NeXT!", "You should donate it to a museum," "I would love to use it personally," and so on. I even received enthusiastic messages from people overseas saying "I would love to take it off your hands!"

Sending my beloved NeXT to a museum
After considering various options, I realized that the best way to ensure that my NeXT machine is put to good use and enjoyed by many would be to donate it to the Dream Computer Museum in Ome. According to the museum, they will display my machine as long as it still works, so donating it to them seemed like the best option. Visitors will be able to interact with it, and I encourage anyone interested to visit the museum in Ome.

However, please note that the museum is planning to relocate and expand in April 2023, and my NeXT machine will not be on display until around July after the move. I am excited to see it once it is on display. All in all, I am happy to have found a good home for my beloved NeXT!
